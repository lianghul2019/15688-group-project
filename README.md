This project focus on analyzing Data for Grammy, we applied our analysis on Grammy Awards. 

We used data from three resources:
  1. YouTube Data API v3
  2. Wikipedia -- All nominees in the history of Grammy Awards
  3. Spotify Web API

We applied our data analysis on four aspects:
  1. Time Series Analysis on 2020 Nominees
  2. Sentiment Analysis on comments
  3. Word Cloud Generated on comments
  4. Historical data on music genres

Besides, based on data analysis of Grammy Rewards, we also constructed predictors and evaluate our models.
